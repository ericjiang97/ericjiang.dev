This article is inspired by Josh Farr’s post about ‘Given it’s 2018 and knowing what you know now, what advice would you give to your 16-year old self?’

You can find the original post here: [https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6407742813550837760](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6407742813550837760)

So you can find my answer to this question below.

## 'Don’t only just study, go out explore and make the world a better place’

I’ve also taken the position that University is not only about studying, it’s also about how you learn and make a contribution to society. So why not start early? I’ve previously written an article about this, check it out below:

[https://medium.com/monplan/how-to-do-your-best-whilst-studying-at-university-tech-version-61f43ee45ea5](https://medium.com/monplan/how-to-do-your-best-whilst-studying-at-university-tech-version-61f43ee45ea5)

But this is not always about tech. Yes it is true, we currently live in a digital world, there’s always ways to make a difference to the world.

- [Kai Kloepfer wanted to reduce gun violence in the US , he developed a fingerprint-sensor gun for the US](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/voices-against-violence-kai-kloepfer/)
- [Amber Yang wanted to help reduce collisions with Space Junk, so she built a ML model that predicted impacts](https://www.vox.com/videos/2018/4/25/17279414/19-year-old-space-debris-ai-solution-seer-tracking)


These examples may seem too ambitious, I know a lot of problems exist in the world, but there aren’t any solutions. Some other examples include:

- Monash University’s Timetable Allocation Swaps was done manually through in-person swaps then contacting Student Enrolments, etc…..(this was a very tedious approach). So a bunch of guys (Ishan Joshi, Surayez Rahman and Arni Mittal) got together during a Hackathon, built a demo. Over the later half of 2017 they worked with parts of the university (and Ben Clare joined the team) and this was launched as a pilot product during Semester 1 2018 — SwapMe

Even the two/three projects that I’ve built was around solving problems (they weren’t necessarily and still not part of my course):
MonPlan was built to solve the problem where a student wants to figure out how their course should look like without have to go in to see a course adviser
MARIE.js digitalise a old Java based application
geckoDM was built to solve harder to download lectures over the echo360 platform, we have expanded from one university to users across 4 countries.

So, studying at university helps you to learn how you should study. Because you should never stop learning (I sort of tied that into Monash University’s motto — Ancora Imparo (or “I’m still learning”)
