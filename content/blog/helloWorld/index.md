ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! Welcome to my blog!!! Over the past few years I have built various personal sites, this is my new site - it is built on GatsbyJS on [Netlify](https://netlify.com). Previously my sites was on services such as GitHub Pages (using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io)), Google Cloud Platform and Amazon Web Services (using [WordPress](https://wordpress.org))

Anyways, I am currently in my final year of my Bachelor of Information Technology degree and I'm still currently building [MonPlan](https://monplan.apps.monash.edu). Also, I am saying sorry in advance because I will be posting quite a bit of memes within my code.

So sit back, relax and enjoy my rants.
