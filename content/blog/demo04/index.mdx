That was quick! 2018 went by in a breeze and we’re here with a new year. For me this year, it was about making a difference to the community.

Firstly, a big thank you to everyone (friends, family, co-workers) who have supported me throughout this year. And all the best for 2019!

# MonPlan

As many of you know, [MonPlan](https://monplan.apps.monash.edu) this year has been bigger than ever. In February, 
we [launched MonPlan into beta](https://medium.com/monplan/monplan-beta-and-v2018-0-0-release-248c33c9c904) – which is one of our biggest launches ever. 
The university adopted our product as the official course planning tool shortly afterwards. 
And just recently in October, we officially released MonPlan – a big thank you goes out to everyone who has supported us all the way through the journey.

- Firstly I would like to thank [Josh Nelsson-Smith](https://jnelssonsmith.com/) who co-founded this awesome project with me, having working with him for the best part of 2 years, having supporting me when I was feeling not that great and learning a great many things with me was really amazing.
- Another amazing person that I would like to thank is Saurabh Joshi, Saurabh is a really amazing person who is really great at what he does, but without his initial help at the start of the project MonPlan wouldn’t be where it is at.
- All the awesome team members that we had: Charlie Campton-Strachan, David Copley, [Robert Koch](https://kochie.io), Harry Ferrier, [David Lei](https://www.notdavid.me), Callistus Tan, Katie Ng, [Nicholas Whittaker](https://nchlswhttkr.com), Rebecca Young and Ben Clare: you guys really helped us get over the finish line, even though our team shrank in size and grew many times – but without the effort from you guys we wouldn’t be where we are.
- All the staff, managers and senior executives at eSolutions (such as Linh Truong, Chau Lam, Teresa Finlayson)
- Lastly, all the friends who have supported me: Emily Dao, Michael Williams and Nick Priebatsch. I know that I’ve thanked you already, but without you guys being there for me and listening to me ramble about random stuff, I wouldn’t have been able to get most of the stress out.

# Tech community
For me, this year I’ve participated across two hacks: Hackamon and UniHack. I mentored at this years Hackamon instead of competing, helping others grow ideas, giving them tips on pitching is something that is really enjoyable and seeing an idea grow into a solution is what makes the entire experience worthwhile. As well as giving out two Tech talks on Git and rapid prototyping.

Giving back to the community is something that I believe that every tech person should do. This year I’ve been part of 2 meetup communities: JuniorDev and MusesCode (formerly NodeGirls Melbourne). For JuniorDev, I’ve given 1 tech talk (on GCP with NodeJS) and once again mentored at this year’s Hacktoberfest event. I’ve also mentored at an event aimed at teaching JavaScript/NodeJS/ECMAScript to beginners, as part of the MusesCode meetup community.

# Hobbies
This year, I’ve picked up photography as a hobby – around September I brought a new Canon 800D DSLR. And have slowly taking photos and learnt how to process them through Photoshop. Check out some of my best photos [here](https://flickr.com/people/lorderikir)

# Travel
I know that I told myself that I would travel last year in 2017 but then it got busy.

This year I ended up going to both Japan (with friends) and China (solo) for around 5 weeks: which has been really fun. Big thanks to everyone who have travelled with me and made the experience more enjoyable. I really want to head back to Japan at some point in the future – maybe to the northern part (like Hokkaido) next time.

I am really looking forward to 2019 – with new ideas (and with it, startup opportunities), looking for grad/junior/entry level positions and finishing off my degree part-time, new hobbies and friends, potentially more travelling – I’m sure it will be an awesome year.
