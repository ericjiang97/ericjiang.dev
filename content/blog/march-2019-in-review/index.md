As I previous stated back in late February 2019, that this year was going to be hectic. Over the past couple of weeks I've been quite busy, with:

- Going up to Sydney for the **[2019 itNews Benchmark Awards](https://www.itnews.com.au/awards/about)** - in which I manage to win the Rising Star Category, you can read more about that [here](./20190314-benchmark-awards)
- Did my first round video technical interview with [Google](https://google.com) for a Test Engineering (SRE) role in Taiwan! ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡¼. Fingers-crossed on getting into next stage of the interviews
- Was at Industry Night promoting [MonPlan](https://monplan.apps.monash.edu) and working with [eSolutions](https://monash.edu/esolutions), [Monash University](https://monash.edu)
- MonPlan will be placed in Operational Mode as of 1st April - meaning that all the major bugs/issues have been resolved.
- Signed a new contract with Monash Uni, and as of 1st April - I've been promoted from a Junior Software Engineer into a Software Engineer!
- I've been elected the Graduate Representative of Wired Monash, which is the IT Student Club at Monash.

## Interviewing with Google

Yep, that's right despite my not so good grades/GPA, I've managed to snag a video interview with Google.
