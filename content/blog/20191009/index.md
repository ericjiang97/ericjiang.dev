It's with mixed feelings to announce that I've decided to leave my role as a Software Engineer at Monash University in November. This was a really hard decision for me, as I really enjoy studying at Monash whilst at the same time delivering impact and change to my fellow students. I will be moving to Taiwan to begin the next stage in my career as a Test Engineer at Google.

I started at Monash University back in December 2016 to work on MonPlan - these past two and a half years have been an amazing journey for me. I still can’t believe that we have officially released it back in October 2018, and that there are over 12000 students and staff using it.

A big thanks to all the managers & everyone who has been part of my journey so far, it's been wonderful learning from everyone and I really enjoyed working at Monash.

But without the support of the senior managers, and the executive team within the CIO Portfolio and the University, I don’t think we delivered an impact this big to everyone across the University.

P.S. Do let me know if you want to catch up before I leave.
